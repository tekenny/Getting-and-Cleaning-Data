# Code 

This code book descirbes the raw input data, processing transformations of the data and the resulting tidy output data.

# Raw input data

The raw data used was experimental observations from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" by the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems. More details regarding this data set can be obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The actual rawe data was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Variables

# Processing performed by run_analysis.R

TBD

# Processed tidy output data

# TBD
Was code book submitted to GitHub that modifies and updates the codebooks available to you with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries you calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information?
