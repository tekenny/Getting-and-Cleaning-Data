# Code 

This code book descirbes the raw input data, processing transformations of the data and the resulting tidy output data.

# Raw input data

The raw data used was experimental observations from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" by the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems. More details regarding this data set can be obtained from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The actual rawe data was downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
