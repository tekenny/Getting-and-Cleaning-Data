# About the run_analysis.R script

The run_analysis.R script is an R script which performs the following high level steps to transform the raw input data to the tidy output data.

  1 - Read and then merge the test and the train raw data to create one data set<br>
  2 - Extract only the mean and standard deviation measurements<br>
  3 - Mutate activity variables from codes to descriptive activity names<br>
  4 - Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names<br>
  5 - Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
