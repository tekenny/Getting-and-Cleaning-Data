# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

# Introduction

This repo contains the code book, script and tidy output data for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course project

# About the Code Book

The CodeBook.md file explains how the raw data was transformed into a tidy dataset. It also provides details regarding the data variables.

# About the raw input data

The raw input data represents data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The actual raw data I uased may be obtained from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

# About the run_analysis.R script

The run_analysis.R script is an R script which performs the following high level steps to transform the raw input data to the tidy output data.

1 - Read and then merge the test and the train raw data to create one data set<br>
2 - Extract only the mean and standard deviation measurements<br>
3 - Mutate activity variables from codes to descriptive activity names<br>
4 - Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names<br>
5 - Create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

# About the tidy output data

The tidy ouput data generated by the script can be found in analysis.txt and more details about it's content can be found in CodeBook.md
